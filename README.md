# Machine-learning-in-business---OilyGiant-mining
In this project for the OilyGiant mining, my task is to find the best place for a new well.
I will:
1. Collect the oil well parameters in the selected region: oil quality and volume of reserves;
2. Build a model for predicting the volume of reserves in the new wells;
3. Pick the oil wells with the highest estimated values;
4. Pick the region with the highest total profit for the selected oil wells, after risk evaluation.
